## Usage
```
--library [path]                   Library to analyze (i.e., a folder containing pdf files of academic papers)
```

To visualize the results, open the HTML file `src/main/html/main.html` once the analysis is complete. Note that, depending on the number of papers in your library, the analysis may take a while.

### Assumptions
Currently, library-visualizer assumes that your pdf file names have the form `year - title.pdf`.
