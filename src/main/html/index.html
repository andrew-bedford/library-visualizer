Unsurprisingly, most products failed at detecting variants of known malware families.</li><li>These crucial aspects are not really taken into account by state-of-the-art malware detector testing approaches [12, 13, 18]. The only attempt at scalability and automation is Google’s VirusTotal service2, which appears similar in spirit to our research vision.</li><li>Recently, Zheng et al. [18] and Rastogi et al. [13] continued along the same line by proposing and testing code-transformation procedures for the Dalvik VM and ARM. The assumption behind this research line is that malware authors will rely on (similar) code-transformation procedures to evade static signatures: Therefore, evaluating malware detectors against mutants is a good estimation of their robustness to future malware.</li><li>Although [13, 18] have some technical limitations (i.e., corner cases that, according to our experience, produce APKs that do not run properly on some Android versions), we believe that they cover extensively this research direction.

Virtually all of these tools are configured with a privacy policy, usually defined in terms of lists of sources of sensitive data (e.g., the user’s current location) and sinks of potential channels through which such data could leak to an adversary (e.g., a network connection).</li><li>5.3 RQ3: Existing Lists of Sources & Sinks In this section we assess to what extent current static [1,  2, 12,15,16,20,23,24,33] and dynamic code analysis [11, 32] approaches could benefit from our categorized sources/sinks list. As our results show, SuSi finds all the sources and sinks these previous approaches mention, plus many others which the community was previously unaware of.</li><li>Aurasium [32] shifts the problem of identifying sources  and sinks by intercepting calls at the system level, i.e., between the native Android libraries and the standard Linux system libraries. While this reduces the number of methods to consider, it makes it harder to reconstruct higher-level semantics, and is failure-prone in case of Android version upgrades.</li><li>To protect the user’s privacy, di↵erent kinds of taint-tracking approaches have been proposed, both static [1, 2, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 33, 35] and dynamic [11, 19, 30, 32]. As already described in Section 1, such approaches are only as good as the source and sink lists they are configured with.</li></ul></div><div class="reference" data-title="Harvester - Harvesting Runtime Data in Android Applications for Identifying Malware and Enhancing Code Analysis"><span class="reference-header">In \'Harvester - Harvesting Runtime Data in Android Applications for Identifying Malware and Enhancing Code Analysis\' as [47]</span><ul><li>Other techniques such as Aurasium [47] inject a native code layer between the operating system and the Android application which intercepts sensitive API calls and checks the data passed to them. All these approaches share the problem of only finding values in code that is actually executed, thus requiring a test driver with full code coverage.</li></ul></div><div class="reference" data-title="TaintART - A practical multi-level information-flow tracking system for android runtime"><span class="reference-header">In \'TaintART - A practical multi-level information-flow tracking system for android runtime\' as [58]</span><ul><li>Aurasium [58] and RetroSkeleton [17] can add enforcement policies and fine-grained mandatory access control on sensitive API invocations by rewriting and repackaging apps.</li></ul></div>' },
